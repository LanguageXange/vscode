#### Version 0.0.4

Initial release of ZTM Blog Post Search Extension

**Enjoy Reading ZTM Blog Posts!**

#### Notes:

1. The name of your VS code extension is defined in `"displayName": "XXXXXX"` inside `package.json` file
2. Every time you make any updates and want to republish your VS code extension, please remember to change the ` "version": "X.X.X"` in `package.json` file
3. The folder structure might look really daunting at first, but it's just JavaScript! The most important file is the `extension.js` (where all the magic happens!) I highly recommend you check out the links below!
